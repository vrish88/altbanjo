improvements, or to even add your own tab!

Formatting
----------

There aren't very many rules but they are meant to keep the tabs
readable and clean.

1. Specify the tuning on the left hand side of every line.

        D:-----
        B:----1
        G:-0h2-
        D:-----
        A#:----

2. Have a minimum of 16 notes per measure (basically 16 '-'). If the
   song requires more notations (like hammer-ons or slides) that is
fine, just make sure that the vertical pipes ('|') at the end of the
measure line up.

        D:-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
        B:-----------3-----|--2-------5-------3-------6-------6---------8----9--|
        G:-----------2-----|--0-------3-------2-------5-------7---------9----10-|
        D:-0-----3-------2-|------5-------3------3/7------8------8-9-10---11----|

3. Try not to have more 4 measures per line so that people don't have to
   scroll.

4. Use the additional notations:

        p   - pull off
        h   - hammer on
        /   - slide up
        \   - slide down
        x   - ghost note
        (4) - optional note
        _3_
        ||| - triplet
