Lyrics:
Will you say when I'm gone away
"My lover came to me and we'd lay
In rooms unfamiliar but until now"

Will you say to them when I'm gone
"I loved your son for his sturdy arms
We both learned to cradle then live without"

Will you say when I'm gone away
'Your father's body was judgement day
We both dove and rose to the riverside"

Will you say to me when I'm gone
"Your face has faded but lingers on
Because light strikes a deal with each coming night"
